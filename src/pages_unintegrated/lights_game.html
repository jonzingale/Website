    <h1>Two WoW puzzles, one solution.</h1>

    <div class='content'>
      Outside of occasionally playing online go, I am almost completely ignorant
      of online gaming. By contrast, my friend Alec has been a World of Warcraft
      nerd for many years, participating in hundreds of raids and thinking deeply
      about group strategy. One day, after spending the night chatting with a
      fellow guildy, Alec presented me with a lights game puzzle. He writes:
    </div>
    <div class='sub-story'>
      I was hanging out in World of Warcraft one day, and a guildy was looking
      for the blue mechanowolf (Friender) pet for his Hunter. He came across the
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQUVsLK5kZY&t=115">lights puzzle</a>
      in Gnomeregan which summons Friender for you to tame, and was having
      trouble solving it. He asked for help in guild chat, and being a lover of
      puzzles, I decided I wanted to take a look. The puzzle is pretty simple.
      You have a set of 8 lights, some of which are on, and some of which are
      off. If you click on a light, it toggles that light and the ones next to
      it. The object is to get all of the lights to be turned on.

      Unfortunately, we were struggling to solve it. In fact, if you attempt to
      solve the example I’ve given you, you’ll find it’s impossible. Surprised
      that I couldn’t solve this when it seemed so simple, I took the puzzle to
      bed with me on a notebook, using binary representation to write out steps.
      Using the above example, I would have written <code>10110000</code> on my
      notebook with <code>01010000</code> underneath it to indicate the new
      sequence after clicking the second light. I finally gave up around
      3:00 AM, extremely frustrated. The next morning, I went into work and
      decided I was going to ask my co-worker Jon about this. I was fairly
      certain that there was no solution to the puzzle, but I wanted to ask Jon
      if there was a way to prove mathematically that the sequence
      <code>11111111</code> is impossible to reach from the sequence
      <code>10110000</code>, given the rules of the puzzle.
    </div>
    <div class='content'>
      <div class='pp'>
        After thinking about the problem for a while, I found that Alec was
        correct. Given a particular starting state only half of the possible
        configurations are reachable. This means that half of the possible
        starting states can reach <code>11111111</code>, but for the other
        half the game has no solution! I reasoned as follows:
      </div>
      <div class='pp'>
        Imagining each light to be independent of any other,
        the 8 lights can be in any of \(2^8\) starting configurations.
        I aim to show that the 8 operations on the lights are actually
        <i>dependent</i> on one another and therefore not all 256 configurations
        can be reached from any other. Further, from any starting configuration
        only half of the configurations can be reached.
      </div>
      <div class='pp'>
        Let us begin by considering the independent case.
        Each light can be in any of two states, either on
        or off. For modeling purposes let us assign the
        number 1 to an on state and 0 to an off state.
        Also, let us assign the function <code>add 1 modulo 2</code>,
        which we will denote \(+ 1\), to the act of changing a single
        light from its current state to its other state. In other
        words we are mathematically representing the actions on a
        single light as the cyclic group \(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\) generated
        by \(+ 1\).
      </div>
      <div class='pp'>
      <div class='pp'>Effectively this means:
      <ul>
      <li> performing \(+ 1\) an odd number of times affects the same
      change on a light as just performing \(+ 1\) once. Let us denote
      any performance like this with an <b>a</b> for action. By parallel,
      we notice that performing \(+ 1\) an even number of times effects
      no change at all. Let us denote this trivial change by <b>e</b>.
      Performing either <b>a</b> or <b>e</b> are the only two actions we can
      perform on a given light, a(1) = 0 for instance.
      </li>
      <li>
      Actions themselves can be composed. We can <i>perform</i> <b>a</b>
      twice and then <i>perform</i> <b>e</b>. For simplicity, I will show
      this composition by juxtaposition, ie. \(eaa\). Note that my
      composition <i>reads</i> from left to right.
      Both actions are self inverse and thus performing either
      of them an even number of times is the same as doing nothing,
      aa = e or ee = e. This means that pairs of the same action
      can be <i>cancelled</i> from a performance, ie.
      $$
      aeaaeeea\\
      aeeeea\\
      aeea\\
      aa\\
      e
      $$
      </li>
      <li>
      Possibly most crucially, performing the same actions in one
      order versus another makes no difference to the outcome, ie.
      \(aeaaeeea = aaaaeeee\).
      This last property of the group is called the Abelian property.
      </li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='pp'>
      Allow now for a leap of abstraction. While any one light can be
      represented by one of our cyclic groups \(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\), we
      can also consider pairs of \(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\)s to represent pairs
      of lights (or more generally n copies of \(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\) can
      represent n many lights).
      Now where elements of \(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\) are either 1 or 0,
      elements of pairs of \(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\) can be written
      \((0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)\), corresponding to the 4 configurations
      the pair of lights can be found. Similarly, actions on these states can be
      written \((e, e), (e, a), (a, e), (a, a)\). The act of performing paired
      operations like \((e, a)\) on paired states like \((1, 1)\) can be
      defined pairwise giving: \((e, a) (1, 1) = (e(1), a(1)) = (1, 0)\).
      Notice how the bulleted properties above extend nicely.
      <ul>
      <li>Performing either (e, e), (e, a), (a, e), or (a, a) are the
      only actions we can perform on a given pair of lights. Further,
      (e, a) and (a, e) are generators in that combinations of these two
      can be used to get to any other possible state.</li>

      <li>Each action is self inverse.</li>

      <li>This newly formed group of pairs has the Abelian property.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='pp'>
      This suggests more generally that for n lights we can construct
      an n-fold Abelian group whose elements \(a1 ... an\) designate
      any of \(2^n\) possible light configurations and whose actions
      \(f_1 ... f_n\) designate any of \(2^n\) possible ways to effect n lights.
      Notice, that this model preserves the independence of any given
      light. In other words, the only way to change the light in the jth
      place in the a list, \(a_1...a_j...a_n\) is by having \(f_j\) be an <b>a</b>,
      ie. \(00010000+ eeeaeeae = 00000010\).
      </div>

      This fact has far-reaching consequences for us. If we are to write
      out each of the n generators for the n-fold Abelian group,
      $$
      f_1 = a e e ... e\\
      f_2 = e a e ... e\\
      f_3 = e e a ... e\\
      ...\\
      f_n = e e e ... a\\
      $$
      <div class='pp'>
      Not one of them can be expressed as the combination of any of
      the others. Changing the jth and kth light has no effect on the mth.
      These n independent actions form what is called a basis for our group.
      That no action can be written as the sum of any others also means
      that from any configuration on n lights we can get to any of \(2^n\)
      light configurations by applying combinations of the n actions.
      With 8 lights, for instance, we can get to any of \(2^8 = 256\)
      configurations via combinations of the 8 basis actions.
      </div>
      <div class='pp'>
      If, on the other hand, the actions were dependent so that some
      action, \(f_j\), could be performed as the combination of any of the
      others, \(f_j = f_1f_3f_2\) say, so would any performance involving \(f_j\)
      be dependent on a combination of \(f_1f_3f_2\). This means that we
      could only reach \(2^{n-1}\) possible configurations, \(2^7 = 128\) in
      our example.
      </div>
      <div class='pp'>
      Now for the punchline (no longer the independent case but rather
      the actual case). The light game has 8 possible actions. Each action
      effects a small handful of lights. Changing the leftmost light, for
      example, also effects its next closest neighbor to the right.
      Generally, changing any light also effects that lights nearest adjacent
      lights. If these actions were independent, they could be used to
      reach any of 256 configurations for any starting configuration.
      If instead we can perform any action as the combination of any others,
      we can then only reach 128 configurations, ie half of the possible
      configurations.
      </div>
      <div class='pp'>
      Notice, that performing \(f_1f_5f_4f_2f_7\) as above, is the same as
      performing \(f_8\). This means that \(f_8\) is dependent on
      \(f_1\),\(f_5\),\(f_4\),\(f_2\) and \(f_7\). From the reasoning above, this
      means that \(f_8\) does not contribute uniquely to arriving at any
      configurations we otherwise could get to using the other actions and
      therefore the total number of configurations we can arrive at with \(f_1\)
      through \(f_7\) is 128, ie. less than 256.
      </div>
      <div class='pp'>
      Of course, we could have instead thought of the 8 operations as being a
      basis for a vector space and considered them as the rows of a matrix.
      Then by computing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination">
      Gaussian elimination</a> we would see that only 7 of these vectors form a
      basis, ie. one of the rows would be zero. Further, the 7 vectors form a
      basis for a space with 128 elements. This means that for any given initial
      configuration, only 1/2 of the total configurations can be reached, as is
      intended to be shown.
      </div>
      <div class='pp'>
      Lastly, this particular puzzle reappears in a different form later on in
      the game. There it appears as the
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPjYDD5hra0&t=10">Shaman's Totem
      puzzle</a>. Though the game pictorially has been extended to a
      2-dimensional playing field, the mathematics works out the same. Here
      instead of 8 lights there are 25 lights. Encoding these as binary vectors
      and computing Gaussian elimination gives the basis for the space of
      accessible light configurations, which btw IS fully accessible for any
      starting configuration ;)
