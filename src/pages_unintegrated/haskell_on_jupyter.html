      Recently, I have found myself leading a Haskell programming group in Santa
      Fe, New Mexico. These meetings have been a great opportunity to actually
      learn to apply Haskell. Included here are some of my notes.

      <h2><a href="./haskell_on_jupyter/HTF.html">Haskell Test Framework</a></h2>
      Having a reliable test framework is an amazing thing. Here is a small
      collection of notes describing some of the features and organizational
      structure of the <code>Haskell Test Framework</code>​ (HTF). Most of the
      examples are designed for my recent work developing a ray tracing algorithm.

      <h2><a href="./haskell_on_jupyter/listable.html">Listable</a></h2>
      Here we write some methods for treating Integers as lists in the sense that
      we can define notions of <code>take, drop, (:), (++), and unit </code>
      on Integers. From these we derive further functionality, namely:
      <code>length, reverse, head, tail, and (!!)</code>. Since clearly both
      Integers and Lists are both instances of the same functionality, we define
      a class <a href="./haskell_on_jupyter/listable.html">Listable</a>
      handling both.

      <h2><a href="./haskell_on_jupyter/sortable.html">Sortable</a></h2>
      Now that there is a Listable class, we extend Listable things to be Sortable
      things. Put another way, given <code>(Ord a, Listable a) => a</code> we
      define a class whose instances can be sorted via <code>sort</code> and
      shuffled via <code>shuffle</code>. The sort is a quick-sort and the shuffle
      is a key-shuffle.

      <h2><a href="./haskell_on_jupyter/vector.html">Vector</a></h2>
      <a href="./haskell_on_jupyter/vector.html">Vector</a> is a module designed to
      facilitate mathematical vector operations in the Hermitian style. For
      simplicity, I model only three-dimensional vectors but allow the underlying
      fields to be arbitrary. Complex and Double serve as example fields
      throughout.

      <h2><a href="./haskell_on_jupyter/abelian_actions.html">Abelian Actions on a Zipper</a></h2>
      The goal here is to write an <code>Action</code> class which depends on an
      <code>Abelian</code> data type and acts on a <code>Zipper</code> type.
      Composition of left Abelian actions <code>Ab x G -> G</code> and evaluation
      are then given in the instance declaration for
      <code>Action (Zipper v)</code>.

      <h2><a href="./haskell_on_jupyter/havelHakimi.html">Havel Hakimi Graphs</a></h2>
      The Swiss-McMahon tournament can be seen as a special case of the
      Erdős–Gallai theorem and as such, the Havel-Hakimi algorithm can be used to
      produce graphic tournaments. This module is designed to facilitate the
      production of these graphs.

      <h2><a href="./haskell_on_jupyter/umeboshi.html">Umeboshi</a></h2>
      <a href="./haskell_on_jupyter/umeboshi.html">Umeboshi</a> is a drum machine
      written in Haskell and built from a Roland 808 sound bank. The drum machine
      is designed to facilitate poly-rhythmic percussion in non-standard time
      signatures. It relies heavily <code>Unboxed Vector</code> types and the
      <code>Data.WAVE</code> library.
