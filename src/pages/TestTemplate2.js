            Recently, I have found myself leading a Haskell programming group in Santa
            Fe, New Mexico. These meetings have been a great opportunity to actually
            learn to apply Haskell. Included here are some of my notes.

            Having a reliable test framework is an amazing thing. Here is a small
            collection of notes describing some of the features and organizational
            structure of the <code>Haskell Test Framework</code>â€‹ (HTF). Most of the
            examples are designed for my recent work developing a ray tracing algorithm.
