          Recently, I have found myself leading a Haskell programming group in Santa
          Fe, New Mexico. These meetings have been a great opportunity to actually
          learn to apply Haskell. Included here are some of my notes.

          Having a reliable test framework is an amazing thing. Here is a small
          collection of notes describing some of the features and organizational
          structure of the <code>SOME CODE THAT YEAH</code>â€‹ (HTF). Most of the
          examples are designed for my recent work developing a ray tracing algorithm.
